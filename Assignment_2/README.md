# Children Involved in Sports Activities (1998-2018) by Poverty Status

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create data visualizations using bar charts to represent temporal data. Bar charts are well-suited for comparing data across time periods, making them appropriate for this analysis. For this project, a dataset representing children aged 6 to 17 involved in sports activities by poverty status between 1998 and 2018 was selected.

The data visualized comes from the U.S. Census Bureau and provides valuable insights into the correlation between poverty status and children's involvement in sports activities.

## Data Visualizations

- **Bar Chart**: Displays the percentage and total number of children aged 6 to 17 participating in sports activities, segmented by poverty status across multiple years.
- The data was visualized using **Seaborn** to effectively highlight trends over time.

## Data Source

The data for this project was sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau's [Childrenâ€™s Involvement in Activities](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/children/childs-day.html) report.
