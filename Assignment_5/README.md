# COVID-19 Cases Visualization (Spatial Data)

## Project Overview
This project visualizes COVID-19 case data across the United States using spatial data. Two maps are generated to highlight trends in 2022:
1. A map of the total new COVID-19 cases by state, visualized with a color bar to represent the total case count in each state.
2. A map displaying the weekly case rate per 100,000 people by state, also using a color bar to help quantify and compare the rate of new cases.

These visualizations offer a clear, comparative view of COVID-19 impacts across states in 2022.

## Visualization Details
- **Map 1**: Total new COVID-19 cases by state (2022)
- **Map 2**: Weekly COVID-19 case rate per 100,000 by state (2022)
  
Both maps utilize color bars to quantify case data for easier interpretation and analysis.

## Tools Utilized
- **GeoPandas**: For creating map visualizations and handling spatial data.
