# G7 Renewable Energy Consumption and CO2 Emissions Data Visualization Project (2009-2019)

## Project Overview
In this project, clear and informative data visualizations are created using temporal data to showcase trends over time. The selected dataset focuses on the 10-year trends (2009-2019) of renewable energy consumption and CO2 emissions across G7 countries. These visualizations aim to provide insights into how renewable energy usage and CO2 emissions have changed in these countries over the specified period.

Two separate line charts were created using Matplotlib:
- **Renewable Energy Consumption (2009-2019)**
- **CO2 Emissions (2009-2019)**

## Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from the [World Bank World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators).
