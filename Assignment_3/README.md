# Hierarchical & Part-to-Whole Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview
This project visualizes hierarchical and part-to-whole data by comparing the percentage contribution of global CO2 emissions by country. A pie chart was created to represent the distribution of CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2019, focusing on the five countries—China, the US, India, Russia, and Japan—that together contribute roughly 60% of the world's total CO2 emissions. The remaining emissions from other countries were grouped under "Rest of World."

## Data Visualization
- The pie chart highlights the proportion of emissions contributed by each country, providing a clear view of the hierarchical structure of global emissions and their part-to-whole relationship.
- Matplotlib was used to generate the pie chart.
