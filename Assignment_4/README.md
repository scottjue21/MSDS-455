# NHL Team Statistics Visualization (2021-2022 Season)

## Project Overview
This project visualizes NHL team statistics from the 2021-2022 season using parallel coordinates plots. The goal of the visualization is to highlight key metrics that differentiate top-ranked teams from lower-ranked teams based on their performance in various statistical categories. The statistics included in the plot are average team age, goals for per game, goals against per game, power play percentage, penalty kill percentage, shots on goal, and goalie save percentage. By comparing these metrics, insights can be generated on how certain performance indicators contributed to overall team success.
